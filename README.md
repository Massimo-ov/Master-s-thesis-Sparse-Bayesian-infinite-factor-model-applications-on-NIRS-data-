## Description

This project provides a clean and fully reproducible **educational implementation** of the  
**Sparse Bayesian Infinite Factor Model (SBIFM)**.

The purpose of this work is primarily **formative**:  
the model has been implemented step by step as part of my learning process  
in Bayesian statistics, hierarchical modeling, and MCMC computation.  
The code has been studied, developed, and refined under the guidance of my thesis advisor.

During the development, I **took inspiration from multiple sources**, including:

- the theoretical and computational material shared by **Dunson & Bhattacharya**,  
  available here: https://github.com/david-dunson/sparse_bayesian_infinite_factor_models  
- and the public GitHub resources made available by **Evan Poworoznek**,  
  available here: https://github.com/poworoznek/infinitefactor  

These resources were extremely helpful in understanding the structure, intuition,  
and practical challenges of sparse Bayesian factor models.

Importantly, **no external R or Python packages implementing SBIFM or related sparse Bayesian factor models were used** for the analyses carried out in this thesis.  
All functions used for simulation, inference, and posterior analysis were developed within this project  
with an explicit educational and methodological goal.
